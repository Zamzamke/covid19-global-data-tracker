# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

This project is a data analysis and visualization notebook that tracks the global trends of COVID-19. It focuses on analyzing key metrics such as confirmed cases, deaths, and vaccination progress across different countries and over time. The goal is to gain insights into how the pandemic evolved and how countries responded with vaccination strategies.

## Objectives

- Import and clean real-world COVID-19 data
- Analyze trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations over time
- Compare COVID-19 metrics across selected countries or regions
- Visualize data using informative charts and maps
- Communicate findings in a well-documented Jupyter Notebook

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python 3
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run or View the Project

## Insights and Reflections

- Countries like the United States and India experienced large waves of cases with noticeable spikes in new cases and deaths during specific time periods.
- Vaccination rollouts varied significantly between countries, with some nations achieving high coverage early while others lagged behind.
- Death rates were influenced by both the number of cases and healthcare capacity, highlighting disparities in global health infrastructure.
- Data cleaning and handling missing values were crucial steps in ensuring accurate analysis and visualization.
- Visual tools like line plots and bar charts made it easier to understand the spread and control of the pandemic across regions.
